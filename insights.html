              What makes you stand out from other Shopify developers?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: block">
              My QA background means I don’t just write functional code — I
              write testable, durable, user-centric code. I think about edge
              cases, performance bottlenecks, and long-term scalability while
              delivering elegant frontend solutions.

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              How do you approach building custom Shopify sections?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I start by understanding the purpose behind the section — is it
              conversion-focused, editorial, or brand-enhancing? Then I design a
              reusable, schema-powered section that empowers content teams to
              control layout, imagery, and behavior. Every section I build is
              cleanly scoped, testable, and responsive across breakpoints.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              Can you describe your QA experience and how it applies to
              development?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I’ve worked with manual and automated testing (including Selenium,
              Cypress, and Postman), led test case planning, and caught critical
              bugs in pre-release cycles. This experience taught me how to debug
              fast, plan for risk, and validate user behavior — all of which
              make my development more informed and stable.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              What’s your process for translating Figma into functional
              sections?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I dissect Figma files layer by layer, noting layout behavior, font
              scaling, spacing logic, and interactive elements. Then I reproduce
              the UI using semantic HTML and CSS, aligning pixel-perfection with
              performance. I maintain open comms with designers to clarify
              intent and suggest scalable improvements where needed.

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              How do you handle cross-browser/device compatibility in your work?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I build mobile-first and test across key breakpoints and devices.
              My QA mindset ensures I check for layout shifts, tap targets,
              accessibility, and browser-specific quirks.

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">Do you write tests as a developer?</h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              Yes — I incorporate testing into my dev flow, including unit tests
              where appropriate and manual QA passes for all interactive
              components. I also write reusable, test-friendly code with QA
              automation in mind.

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              What kind of projects are you most excited by?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              Projects where performance, user experience, and branding meet. I
              love working on interactive custom sections, advanced filtering,
              and anything that challenges me to blend creativity with technical
              depth.

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              What performance optimisations have you implemented on Shopify?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I optimise by lazy-loading assets, deferring non-critical scripts,
              removing unused CSS, and compressing images through Shopify's
              built-in tools and custom logic. I also reduce Liquid loops, cache
              complex logic using `assign`, and minimise DOM reflows to ensure
              smooth interactions and fast load times.
