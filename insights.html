              How do you approach building custom Shopify sections?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: block">
              I start by identifying the section’s role — is it storytelling,
              conversion, or product discovery? I then build a scalable,
              schema-powered section with rich controls that empower content
              teams. Each section is mobile-first, responsive, and
              performance-tuned.

            <h3 class="insight-question">
              What’s your experience with Shopify platform tools and features?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I use Shopify CLI for local theme development, configure
              metafields for dynamic content, and tap into the Storefront API
              for custom front-end logic. I’ve also built schema-rich sections,
              integrated third-party apps, and optimised storefronts for
              performance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="insight-question">
              How do you convert Figma designs into working Shopify sections?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I break down designs into layout rules, spacing logic, and
              component behaviour. I then map each element to semantic HTML and
              responsive CSS. I also flag edge cases or design gaps early — and
              I ensure the result feels exactly like the intended UX.

            <h3 class="insight-question">
              What performance optimisations have you implemented on Shopify?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I’ve lazy-loaded assets, stripped unused CSS, optimised images,
              and deferred non-critical scripts. On the Liquid side, I reduce
              loop nesting, cache complex logic, and avoid layout shifts to keep
              storefronts fast across devices.

            <h3 class="insight-question">
              How do you structure themes for long-term scalability?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I treat each theme as a modular system — breaking functionality
              into reusable sections and blocks, avoiding hardcoded logic, and
              using metafields to keep content dynamic. I also document schema
              options clearly, so content editors can manage the site
              confidently without touching code.

            <h3 class="insight-question">
              How do you debug complex issues in Shopify themes?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I use a layered approach: I inspect Liquid output, analyse network
              requests and browser logs, and isolate component behaviour to
              pinpoint logic issues. Whether it’s a missing metafield, incorrect
              condition, or a rendering quirk, I debug efficiently without
              breaking the flow for users or teams.

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">Do you write tests as a developer?</h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              Absolutely. I write testable components and use tools like
              Playwright and Cypress where appropriate. Even in manual flows, I
              run test passes across devices and screen sizes before pushing. I
              code with automation in mind — even if it's not required yet.

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              What kind of Shopify projects excite you most?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              Projects that blend branding, UX, and engineering — like animated
              landing pages, advanced filters, or custom bundles. I especially
              enjoy building reusable systems where clients can self-manage
              their storefronts with minimal developer hand-holding.

            <h3 class="insight-question">
              What makes you stand out from other Shopify developers?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              I bring a developer’s creativity and a QA engineer’s precision. My
              code isn’t just functional — it’s modular, testable, and built
              with performance and scalability in mind. While many devs ship
              code, I ship solutions that anticipate edge cases and uphold
              long-term quality.
            </p>

          <div class="insight-item">
            <h3 class="insight-question">
              How does your QA experience give you an edge as a developer?
            </h3>
            <p class="insight-answer" style="display: none">
              My QA background means I code with edge cases in mind. I validate
              DOM changes, accessibility, performance, and user flow before any
              QA team touches it. That results in faster approvals and fewer
              bugs — especially in eCommerce, where reliability directly impacts
              revenue.
