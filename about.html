            Hi, I’m <strong>Michael</strong> — a Full-Stack Shopify Developer
            focused on building fast, flexible, and conversion-driven eCommerce
            experiences.
          </p>

          <p>
            I develop Shopify storefronts using custom Liquid components,
            scalable theme architecture, and clean, semantic code. From
            metafield-driven layouts to interactive product filtering and
            performance-optimized sections, I deliver solutions that balance
            functionality and polish.
          </p>

          <p>
            My development approach is UX-aware, edge-case conscious, and
            grounded in modern frontend and backend best practices — including
            reusable JavaScript components, API integrations, and structured
            data strategies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Before becoming a developer, I worked in
            <strong>Quality Assurance</strong> — writing test plans, building
            automation flows, and catching critical issues in complex systems.
            That background didn’t just sharpen my eye for detail — it taught me
            to think across the full product lifecycle: how things are built,
            tested, and experienced by real users.
          </p>

          <p>
            That mindset now shapes everything I build. I write code that’s not
            only efficient, but easier to test, scale, and maintain. It means
            fewer unexpected issues during development, better collaboration
            across teams, and a more dependable process from idea to launch —
            resulting in quicker project turnarounds and stronger user
            experiences.
          </p>

          <h3 class="about-subheading">What sets me apart:</h3>
          <ul class="about-highlights">
            <li>
              I help prevent issues before they happen — and don’t rely on
              others to catch them.
            </li>
            <li>
              I write frontend and backend code with a Quality Assurance mindset
              and ship like a developer.
            </li>
            <li>
              I understand real-world tradeoffs between performance, UX, and
              platform constraints.
            </li>
            <li>I build with both the end user and the team in mind.</li>
